# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: That is a good question as this is something I first learned. Git is a version control software that is a local repository while Github is a version control, cloudservice that is a remote repository. Github is also where your code is stored. 

Researched answer: Git keeps track of your code history (inputting history into your terminal will show your last logs). Github is the management system to help manage your repositories and also is a place of storage for code. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: That is a great question, at this time I'd love to research that question more in order to provide the best possible full answer for you. 

Researched answer: The logical OR || will return a boolean value, but it's asking to compare either or in order to achieve a answer or true/false. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: This is a good question and one that can trip people up so breaking it down is especially good. An index is the spot inside of an array an element lays at. Example being [0, 1, 2] the zero is in the zero index spot which no matter what number or string is in there that will always be the first index. The difference between an index and a value is, an index is the spot where the element lays and the value is what that outcome will be. 

Researched answer: The index is the numerical ordinal position. The value will not be the same index, but it will be the same element. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: That is a great question, arrays are a place for multiple elements to be in while a string is its own representative. 

Researched answer: Arrays are a collection of elements and other data types such as numbers too while strings are a collection of just characters meaning one value for that string. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: That is a great questions and something I've learned quite well. Pair programming is a great way to have multiple eyes on a challenge with one person "the driver" who is sharing their screen and using the keyboard to actually code while your "navigator" is the partner who is double checking the code, helping share what information needs to be in there so the driver can focus on the code itself. 

Researched answer: The driver is writing code while the navigator is ensuring the accuracy of the code such as miss spellings. The navigator should refer to line codes instead of suggesting an element or array or string to look at it, be specific. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Is a function that can receieve a function as an argument and return the function as an ouput. 

2. Jest: A testing framework built by Facebook that ensures the correctness of Javascript. 

3. Objects: An object is an item that has it's own properties and types. 

4. Method: A value with a function. 

5. Classes: A class is a template to create objects.
